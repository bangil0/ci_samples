	<h2>
	The BEST way to use Bootstrap is to only use what you need. Therefore it is wise to compile your final CSS from a preselection of LESS code.
	</h2>

	<p>You can off course just copy over the css files to your own project or start one from scratch with everything included but editing CSS is so much more time-consuming then working with LESS.</p>

	<h2>LESS AND CSS: HOW STYLING WORKS</h2>
	
	<p>
		You can find a folder called "less" in the package you downloaded. LESS is a dynamic way of creating CSS and is used by Bootstrap (will change in version 4 which will have SASS - 
		antoher CSS generator).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I personally use a compiler called Winless to build my css files. A quick explanation on how it works is best described in a screencapture:<br><br>
	</p>
	
	<img src="assets/images/winless.png"><br><br>
	
	<p>
		Your output file should be the css file that you want to compile the code to: in my case this is assets/css/adminpanel/bootstrap3.min.css
	</p>
	<p>
