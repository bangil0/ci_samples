	<h2>ACCESS CONTROL LIST: ROLES AND PERMISSIONS</h2>

    <h3>What are roles?</h3>
    <p>
        Roles are member access profiles which are used to hook permissions on to. So a role is a collection of permissions. Roles are
        applied to members - permissions are not.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>What are permissions?</h3>
    <p>
        Permissions are individual control types for sections of the website. For example we can allow or disallow access to
        the List members page or the settings page. Once a permission is hooked to a role this permission becomes available for all
        members who have received that role.
    </p>
	
	<p>
		Permissions have an order: this is only used on the roles controller page to show the permissions in the order that you want.
	</p>

    <h3>How do we use them?</h3>
    <p>
        There are 2 static methods defined in core/Site_Controller.php:<br>
        - check_roles<br>
        - check_permissions<br>
    </p>
	
	<h4><b>Checking permissions</b></h4>

    example: adminpanel/list_members LINE 224:
    <code>
        <pre>if (! self::check_permissions(6)) {
    redirect("/private/no_access");
}        </pre>
    </code>
    We feed the permission ID to the check_permissions method; we could also pass an array through. The permission ID can be found on adminpanel/permissions.
    Note that you can't delete system permissions because they are required for the iner workings of this script. You can custom permissions for example when
    you create extra pages where special ACL rules are needed.
    <br><br>

    <b>Each method inside our adminpanel controllers is protected by this. We also use them in the constructor to protect a
        whole class in one go (see adminpanel/permissions).</b><br><br>

	<h4><b>Checking roles</b></h4>

    Check_roles is more powerful because we're going to limit access based on a whole access profile:<br>
    consider core/Admin_Controller.php LINE 10 as an example:
    <code>
        <pre>if ( ! self::check_roles(array(1,2,3))) { // catch-all for extra protection on role level
    redirect("/private/no_access");
}</pre>
    </code>
</div>

</body>
</html>
